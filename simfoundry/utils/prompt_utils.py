    "For objects with visible and openable doors and drawers, please also return the number of doors (those with revolute joint, that can rotate around an axis) and drawers (those with prismatic joint, that can slide along a direction).\n\n" + \
    "### Special Requirements ###\n\n" + \
    "1. Treat items that are composed of multiple rigid parts as a single entity; avoid breaking down objects into their components. For instance, mention a wardrobe as one object instead of listing its doors and handles as separate items; " + \
    "2. However, treat items that can be decomposed into completely separate components as individual, separate entities. For instance mention a pot plant/flower as separate objects decomposed into its vase and individual flowers.\n\n" + \
    "3. When captioning, please do not include walls, floors, windows and any items hung from the ceiling in your answer, but please include objects installed or hung on walls.\n\n" + \
    "4. When captioning, please do not include the main surface that the majority of the objects are on. This includes common surfaces such as tables, countertops, etc.\n\n" + \
    "5. When captioning, you can use broader categories. For instance, you can simply specify 'table' instead of 'short coffee table'.\n\n" + \
    "6. Please caption all objects, even if some objects are closely placed, or an object is on top of another, or some objects are small compared to other objects. " + \
    "However, don't come up with objects not in the image or objects that are partially clipped towards the edge of the image.\n\n" + \
    "7. Please do not add 's' or 'es' suffices to countable nouns. For example, you should caption multiple apples as 'apple', not 'apples'.\n\n" + \
    "8. When counting the number of doors and drawer, pay attention to the following:\n\n" + \
    "(1). A child link cannot be a door and a drawer at the same time. When you are not sure if a child link is a door or a drawer, choose the most likely one.\n" + \
    "(2). Please only count openable doors and drawers. Don't include objects with fixed and non-openable drawers/shelves/baskets (e.g., shelves/baskets/statis drawers of bookshelves, shelves, storage carts). For these objects, just give me the caption (e.g., bookshelf, shelf, storage cart).\n\n" + \

    "4. When captioning, be concise but specific, including key distinguishing characteristics when necessary. At least one descriptive adjective should be used. For instance, it is not acceptable to simply specify 'banana'; conversely, it is usually unnecessary to use the overly verbose description 'small banana with brown spots'. Instead, a good example would be 'yellow banana', or 'ripe banana'.\n\n" + \
    "5. If an object has an obvious brand that is seen, please specify it in its description. For example, the caption 'apple iphone' is preferred over the more generic 'cell phone'.\n\n" + \
    "6. Please caption all objects, even if some objects are closely placed, or an object is on top of another, or some objects are small compared to other objects. " + \
    "However, don't come up with objects not in the image or objects that are partially clipped towards the edge of the image.\n\n" + \
    "7. If there are multiple identical objects, only mention a single individual instance. For example, if there are three black pens, only mention 'black pen'.\n\n" + \

1. Every object resting on the support surface is fully visible, and none is hidden behind or underneath another object.
2. The objects occupy as many pixels as possible -- prefer closer viewpoints, because a small object rendered at a low pixel count reconstructs into a poor mesh. Pay particular attention to the SMALLEST object in the scene.

Exactly one of these frames will be used to rebuild the scene in simulation: every object resting on the support surface is cut out of that frame and turned into a 3D mesh, and the support surface is segmented in that frame to fix the ground plane.

1. The support surface: the surface the objects of interest rest on (a table, desk, counter, the floor, ...). Other surfaces may be in view, such as the stand or table the robot is mounted on, or furniture nearby; choose the one the objects of interest stand on, whatever its size.
2. The frame that rebuilds those objects best: each of them fully visible and not hidden behind another object or the robot; as large in the image as possible (the smallest object matters most); sharp; not cut by the image border; the support surface clearly visible.
3. In that frame, the support surface: a short description that a text-prompted segmentation model can find (colour, shape, material; e.g. "white square side table"), and its bounding box.
